Upgrade Notes
-------------

Remote Pruning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Post pruning is now in and comes *enabled by default*, as it is not directly
destructive (it will only delete content that has not been interacted with
locally and which can be re-fetched).

Nevertheless, if you want to avoid post deletion triggering on your server at
all, you should set the ``TAKAHE_REMOTE_PRUNE_HORIZON`` environment variable to
``0``.

VAPID keys and Push notifications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

TakahÄ“ now supports push notifications if you supply a valid VAPID keypair as
the ``TAKAHE_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY`` and ``TAKAHE_VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY`` environment
variables. You can generate a keypair via `https://web-push-codelab.glitch.me/`_.

Note that users of apps may need to sign out and in again to their accounts for
the app to notice that it can now do push notifications. Some apps, like Elk,
may cache the fact your server didn't support it for a while.

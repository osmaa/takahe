0.10
====

*Released: Not Yet Released*

This release is a polish release that is prepping us for the road to 1.0.

This release's major changes:

* Stator, the background task system, has been significantly reworked to require
  smaller indexes, spend less time scheduling, and has had most of its async
  nature removed, as this both reduces deadlocks and improves performance in
  most situations (the context switching was costing more than the gains from
  talking to other servers asynchronously).

* Old remote posts are now automatically pruned out of the database after a
  configurable horizon time, defaulting to 90 days. Posts from local users and
  posts that have been interacted with (liked, boosted, pinned) by local users
  are never deleted. You can change the deletion horizon with the
  ``TAKAHE_REMOTE_PRUNE_HORIZON`` setting.

Minor changes also include:

* Followers-only mode now works correctly inbound and outbound (though outbound
  may need the other server to refresh the profile first).

* Profile pages are no longer shown for remote identities; instead, users are
  linked or redirected directly to the remote profile page.

Upgrade Notes
-------------

Remote Pruning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Post pruning is now in and comes *enabled by default*, as it is not directly
destructive (it will only delete content that has not been interacted with
locally and which can be re-fetched).

Nevertheless, if you want to avoid post deletion triggering on your server at
all, you should set the ``TAKAHE_REMOTE_PRUNE_HORIZON`` environment variable to
``0``.

Migrations
~~~~~~~~~~

There are new database migrations; they are backwards-compatible, but contain
very significant index changes to all of the main tables that may cause the
PostgreSQL deadlock detector to trigger if you attempt to apply them while your
site is live.

We recommend:

* Temporarily stopping all instances of the webserver and Stator
* Applying the migration (should be less than a few minutes on most installs)
* Restarting the instances of webserver and Stator

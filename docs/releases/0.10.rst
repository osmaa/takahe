*Released: Not Yet Released*

This release is a polish release that is prepping us for the road to 1.0.

This release's major changes:

* Stator, the background task system, has been significantly reworked to require
  smaller indexes, spend less time scheduling, and has had most of its async
  nature removed, as this both reduces deadlocks and improves performance in
  most situations (the context switching was costing more than the gains from
  talking to other servers asynchronously).

* TBC

Minor changes also include:

* Followers-only mode now works correctly inbound and outbound (though outbound
  may need the other server to refresh the profile first).

* Profile pages are no longer shown for remote identities; instead, users are
  linked or redirected directly to the remote profile page.

If you'd like to help with code, design, or other areas, see
:doc:`/contributing` to see how to get in touch.

You can download images from `Docker Hub <https://hub.docker.com/r/jointakahe/takahe>`_,
or use the image name ``jointakahe/takahe:0.10``.


Upgrade Notes
-------------

VAPID keys and Push notifications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

TakahÄ“ now supports push notifications if you supply a valid VAPID keypair as
the ``TAKAHE_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY`` and ``TAKAHE_VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY`` environment
variables. You can generate a keypair via `https://web-push-codelab.glitch.me/`_.

Note that users of apps may need to sign out and in again to their accounts for
the app to notice that it can now do push notifications. Some apps, like Elk,
may cache the fact your server didn't support it for a while.


Migrations
~~~~~~~~~~

There are new database migrations; they are backwards-compatible, but contain
very significant index changes to all of the main tables that may cause the
PostgreSQL deadlock detector to trigger if you attempt to apply them while your
site is live.

We recommend:

* Temporarily stopping all instances of the webserver and Stator
* Applying the migration (should be less than a few minutes on most installs)
* Restarting the instances of webserver and Stator
